### Enhancing Financial Decision-Making through ML-Driven Credit Score Classification
In the ever-evolving landscape of financial decision-making, the ability to accurately pre- dict credit scores has become increasingly important for the financial sector. This study investigates the use of machine learning models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of credit score classification, addressing the limitations of traditional manual methods. By leveraging techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, class balancing, and hyperparameter tuning, the research aims to enhance model performance and provide more accurate credit assessments. The study introduces two novel approaches: the use of Adjusted Outlyingness (AO) for outlier detection, which effectively handles skewness in the data, and a feature creation concept to derive potentially influential factors. These techniques, along with comprehensive data preprocessing, set the foundation for robust model development. A range of machine learning models were implemented, including ensemble methods like Extra Trees and Bagging, as well as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Ensemble models, particularly Extra Trees, showed superior performance, achieving an accu- racy of 91% after applying Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to address the class imbalance. The study also emphasizes the impact of hyperparameter tuning in enhancing the performance of models such as KNN and MLP, which initially underperformed. Feature importance analysis revealed that financial behaviors, such as interest rates and outstanding debt, are key factors influencing credit scores, while personal attributes like occupation had little impact. Despite some limitations, such as the use of a single dataset and limited exploration of alternative balancing techniques, the findings provide valuable insights into how machine learning can transform credit score prediction. Future research should explore advanced machine learning algorithms, emerging AI technologies, and real-time credit scoring systems to further enhance prediction accuracy and adaptability. This dissertation advances the field of financial risk assessment by showcasing how machine learning models can offer more accurate and flexible credit scoring systems. These advancements hold significant implications for improving decision-making processes in financial institutions and ensuring more equitable access to credit for consumers.
